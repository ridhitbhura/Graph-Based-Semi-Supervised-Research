## Research Topic
**Optimising Graph Based Semi Supervised Learning on Limited Labelled Data** <br />

## Abstract
<p align="justify">
  In the real world, data often is noisy and may contain any number of missing values and labels. In our investigation, we specifically targeted the problem of how to leverage datasets with limited labels. One approach that was very intriguing to use was to represent the data as graphs and use properties of the generated graph to determine labels for the unlabeled points. The leading question in our investigation was how graphs could help in machine learning with datasets with limited labeling and what approaches to graph based semi-supervised learning are most effective.

More formally, our focus was on reducing/optimizing classification error rate for classification problems in sparsely distributed graphs using graph based semi supervised learning. Due to the presence of limited labelled data in the real world, semi-supervised learning approaches are an efficient way to compound unsupervised learning methods with available data and use them to the best potential. The various models we included were based on datasets corresponding to studies about breast cancer, happiness index in a given town and national flags, all cited in the final report, availible below.
